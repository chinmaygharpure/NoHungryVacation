# Project Title

NoHungryVacation

## Description

NoHungryVacation is a Command-Line Interface(CLI) App which generates a meal plan for users on a vacation based on their location, trip dates, budget, and cuisine preferences. In addition, the algorithm ranks the restaurants by rating and suggests the highest rated restaurants that meet the user criteria. In order to develop this CLI, the Yelp Fusion API and other various Python libraries(datetime, file writing, etc) were used.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests
